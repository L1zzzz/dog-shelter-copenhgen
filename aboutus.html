            <p>Greek Dogs was - and is - an idea that has just grown and grown - a network with the common desire to help the dogs you meet on your holiday in Greece - to do as much as we can to improve conditions for stray dogs, and limit their numbers.</p>
            <p>Many forget the street dog who faithfully accompanied them an entire holiday because they showed it a bit of kindness. But we chose not to forget, not to accept the circumstances and not to give up. For more than 20 years, we have helped as many animals as we could, and limited the number of stray animals in the areas we work.</p>
            <p>We count approx. 40 volunteers working with flea markets, sponsors, such as foster families or visiting teams, facilitators, coordinators, etc.</p>
            <p>We have no expenses for administration, website or anything else, because it is our inalienable principle that everyone helps unpaid so every penny must go uncut to help the animals.</p>
            <p>We are often subjected to harsh criticism because we choose to help animals in another country when there are animals in Denmark that need help. For us, there is no contradiction in helping both, and many of our adoption families have both Danish and Greek dogs.</p>

        <h2>What is the problem is Greece?</h2>

            <p>According to Greek law, it is the responsibility of individual municipalities to provide sterilisation, veterinary care and adoption of dogs and cats on the streets, but municipalities do not live up to this responsibility.</p>
            <p>That is why there are more than 500,000 dogs living on the streets, and even more cats.</p>
            <p>The vast majority of these animals are discarded pets, partly because Greek law does not allow for the humane killing of healthy animals, and partly because Greeks are generally against castrating dogs and cats, resulting in many unwanted whelps  several times a year.</p>
            <p>All this causes that the animals are left on the streets for a life of hunger, disease and abuse. Therefore, it is up to private and animal welfare associations to help.</p>

            <p>Our contacts in Greece are private individuals and small organisations that, like us, work voluntarily and unpaid.</p>
            <p>These contacts run feeding rounds every day, where they know the stray dogs and keep an eye on their state of health and provide sterilisation, castration and veterinary care. We support this work financially with donated medicine and food.</p>
            <p>Adoption itself doesn’t solve problems, it only works if combined with neutralisation to limit the uncontrolled reproduction of unwanted animals. Therefore, we have a castration program which means that everyone who adopts a dog, as part of the payment for the dog, pays an amount to neutralise a dog on the street, which is typically between 100 and 300 DKK.</p>
            <p>With a targeted effort, where we neutralise hundreds of animals every year, we have limited the number of stray animals in the areas we operate, where we also offer locals to neutralise their animals.</p>
            <p>Thanks to donations, and some fantastic sponsors, we receive donations of animal food, blankets, dog toys, flea and worm cures, etc., all of which are sent to the dogs in Greece, and distributed as needed.</p>

            <p>Over the years, we have benefited from people’s generousness - there are almost no limits to the many amazing ideas that have helped Greek Dogs.</p>
            <p>There have been artists who have sold their works for the benefit of our work, sewing rugs, embroidering clothes, making dog toys, holding flea markets, selling fleas via Facebook groups, holding meetings and mini-meetings and walk-a-dog trips.</p>
