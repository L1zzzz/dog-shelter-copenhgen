    <h3>
        A NETWORK OF VOLUNTEERS
<br><br>
 Greek Dogs did not emerge as an association where some people sat down and decided 
 how our organization should be built, how we should work, or who should be chairman.
 <br><br>
 Greek Dogs was - and is - an idea that has just grown and grown - a network with the 
 common desire to help the dogs you as a Danish tourist meet on your holiday in Greece,
 and to do as much as we can to improve conditions for stray 
 dogs, and limit their numbers.

<h1>
    History
</h1>

<div class="pull">

    

    <h3>
        Many forget the street dog who faithfully accompanied them an entire holiday because they 
 showed it a bit of kindness. But we chose not to forget, not to accept the circumstances and
 not to give up. For more than 20 years, we have helped as many animals as we could, and 
 limited the number of stray animals in the areas we work.
 <br><br>
 We count approx. 40 volunteers working with flea markets, sponsors, such as foster families
 or visiting teams, facilitators, coordinators, etc.
 <br><br>
 We have no expenses for administration, website or anything else, because it is our inalienable principle that 
 everyone helps unpaid so every penny must go uncut to help the animals.
